# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Heart Failure, that is, when the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the human body - is one of the most serious killers across the world. As mentioned in Researcher David Chiccoâ€™s paper cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit myocardial infarctions and heart failures. 

This project aims to perform supervised machine learning methods to predict heart failure and identify features that can largely indicate heart failure.
